Stability Selection Research

This repository contains research work conducted on the topic of stability selection, a method in the field of statistical learning and modeling. The fundamental theories and methodologies used in this project are based on the work by Nicolai Meinshausen and Peter Buehlmann.

Overview

- The objective of this research is to further understand, implement, and evaluate the concept of stability selection.
- The research includes a comprehensive study of the original paper by Meinshausen and Buehlmann.
- Alongside this, an effort was made to recreate some of the results mentioned in the paper and conduct simulations to investigate the performance and behavior of stability selection in different scenarios.
- In addition, we compare stability selection with the traditional LASSO method, in order to understand its benefits and potential drawbacks.

Acknowledgments

This work was greatly inspired and made possible by the extensive research done by Nicolai Meinshausen and Peter Buehlmann.


The topic of stability selection is vast and still being explored. Future work may involve expanding on these initial findings and simulations, as well as applying stability selection to more complex or real-world data sets.
